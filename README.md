This repository contains resources and configurations for various Slack automations.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* **`/Workflows/`**: This directory contains the configurations and related files for our Slack workflows.
    * **`/Workflows/Presenter-Reminder/`**:  This subdirectory specifically houses the files for the weekly presenter reminder workflow.  It includes:
        * `triggerWeeklyReminder.js`: The Google Apps Script that triggers the workflow.
        * `README.md`: Documentation for setting up and using the presenter reminder workflow.

## Overview
